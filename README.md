# GoCommand

GoCommand is a simple command-line shell written in Go. It allows users to execute system commands interactively. This shell reads user input, executes commands, and displays output and errors.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute system commands and view their output directly from the shell.
- **Interactive Prompt**: A simple `*` prompt for entering commands.
- **Cross-Platform**: Should work on both Unix-like systems and Windows.

## Installation

To build and run GoCommand, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.com/saniasiddiqui231/gocommand.git
    ```

2. **Run**:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```


## Usage

Once running, the shell will display a `*` prompt. You can enter system commands at the prompt, and the output will be displayed in the terminal. For example:

```bash
* ls
```
